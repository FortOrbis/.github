# FortOrbis
FortOrbis is a collaborative effort to break down the barriers surrounding PS4 modding knowledge. We focus on techniques like SSL pinning bypass and other critical information thatâ€™s often kept behind closed doors.
Our goal is to make this knowledge open, accessible, and easy to find, because no one should have to pay or dig endlessly for something that should be shared freely.     
- Main Repo is [Here](https://github.com/FortOrbis/FortOrbis)  
- Discord [Server](https://discord.gg/y5gRdBP3bH)  

If you're joining the Discord just to flex about already knowing SSL bypassing methods without contributing, this probably isn't the space for you.
