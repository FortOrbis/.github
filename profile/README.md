# FortOrbis
FortOrbis is a community effort to break down the walls surrounding PS4 modding information. We focus on techniques like SSL pinning bypass and other important information that is usually gatekept.
Our goal is to provide this information for free, to make it accessible, and easy to find, because no one should be forced to pay or look around forever for something that should be shared freely.

- Main Repo is [Here](https://github.com/FortOrbis/FortOrbis)  
- Discord [Server](https://discord.gg/y5gRdBP3bH)  

If you're joining the Discord just to flex about already knowing SSL bypassing methods without contributing, this probably isn't the space for you.
